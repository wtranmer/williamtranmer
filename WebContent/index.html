			<h2>CREATING SOLUTIONS</h2>
			<p>Solutions come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes, they jump
				right out at you, but mostly, they like to hide. It takes knowledge
				of the problem space, a few good tools on your belt, and a sharp
				mind to catch them with any regularity. I have the knowledge; I
				have the tools; and I have the mind. I love this stuff.</p>
